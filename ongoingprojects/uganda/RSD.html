                        Diarrheal diseases, linked to poor household access to
                        safe drinking water, are the third leading cause of
                        infant mortality worldwide, accounting for about 20% of
                        deaths among children under five years of age. Both the
                        disease burden and socio-economic costs of poor access
                        to water falls disproportionately on women and children,
                        who are typically responsible for collecting water in
                        developing countries.&nbsp; According to the FAO, women
                        spent up to 8 hours per day collecting water in some
                        parts of Africa.&nbsp; Access to sufficient quantities
                        of water that is uncontaminated and potable is a
                        significant development challenge. Indeed, the sole
                        quantitative environmental target in the United Nations
                        Millennium Development Goals is the call to “reduce by
                        half the proportion of people without sustainable access
                        to safe drinking water.” </span><br>

                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> A
                        newly developed rainwater storage device (RSD)
                        introduced in Uganda by Relief International offers a
                        promising technological solution to the twin problems of
                        lack of access to water in sufficient quantities and of
                        sufficient quality. Water of inadequate quantity and
                        quality hinders human capabilities throughout the
                        developing world, and the success of the rainwater
                        storage device can therefore have welfare consequences
                        of global scale.&nbsp; However, new technologies are
                        only useful to the extent that they are affordable for
                        and acceptable to the intended beneficiaries. Low demand
                        for many different types of technologies seemingly
                        capable of increasing welfare is a central puzzle in
                        development. Salient examples span sectors, ranging from
                        agricultural inputs (high-yield seed varieties and
                        fertilizer) to household health technologies
                        (insecticide-treated bed-nets and point-of-use drinking
                        water treatments).<br>
                        <br>
                        With this potential technological solution in place, we
                        conducted a randomized controlled trial to gauge </span><span
                        style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"></span><span
                        style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">the
                        demand-side responsiveness to that technology in order
                        to: (a) determine what the potential size of the market
                        for the Relief International rainwater storage device
                        might be, (b) identify price points the market can
                        sustain, (c) identify the most effective marketing
                        strategies to promote adoption, and (d) determine
                        whether we can effectively use information dissemination
                        through social networks and other related ‘social
                        marketing’ concepts to create commercial demand for the
                        new product.&nbsp; Moreover, since demand for rainwater
                        storage devices may be attenuated through some important
                        demand-side externalities (e.g. women and children in
                        charge of water collection and most susceptible to
                        water-borne illnesses may be the primary beneficiaries
                        of the new technology, but unfortunately, they may lack
                        decision-making authority over household expenditures),
                        we also use this RCT to measure any social welfare gains
                        from the new technology.&nbsp; Quantifying the social
                        benefits in terms of the reduced time allocation
                        requirement to water collection (which frees up women
                        and children’s time for labor force participation and
                        schooling) or a reduced incidence of diseases associated
                        with consuming contaminated water can help us determine
                        whether the social cost-benefit calculation justifies
                        spending resources on any marketing intervention that
                        helps develop sustainable demand for the product.&nbsp;
                        Before asking the development community to invest
                        resources in this technology, we must develop some
                        comparative sense of costs and returns to rainwater
                        harvesting relative to spring protection, point-of-use
                        drinking water treatments, chlorinated piped water
                        systems and the like.</span><br>

                        &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"><br>
                        In the implementation phase, we randomly varied the
                        incentives and marketing conditions associated with the
                        sale of rainwater storage devices to different
                        households and different villages. We experimentally
                        varied the price for the device by offering discount
                        vouchers to random subsets of households.&nbsp;
                        Variation in prices will allow us to trace out a demand
                        curve for the product, and will also create random
                        variation in adoption decisions that can be used to
                        causally identify the socio-economic consequences of
                        rainwater harvesting in follow up surveys.&nbsp; We also
                        randomized the marketing schemes across the different
                        villages, to test the effectiveness of (say) offering
                        free installation to the first group of users. Proper
                        installation and use by lead adopters may be
                        independently important for the “right type of
                        information” to permeate through social networks about
                        the value of the device.&nbsp; <br>
                        <!-- We implemented this intervention in two distinct
                        waves spread 9-12 months apart to allow for the study of                        the importance of information transmission through                        social networks in generating demand for the new                        technology (i.e. second-wave households would have had                        some indirect experience with the new technology through                        their friends, relatives and neighbors who adopted in                        the first wave).&nbsp; The two-wave strategy also allows                        us to examine whether the overall level of demand
                        changes once society becomes more familiar with the                        product and its price is anchored.&nbsp; Finally, we                        conducted follow-up surveys with all adopters and a                        subset of non-adopters to track socio-economic changes                        subsequent to adoption.<br> !-->
                        <br>
                        Our preliminary results suggest that the demand for this
                        product at market prices is extremely low.&nbsp; One
                        promising result from this research is that consumers in
                        this low-income context seem to highly value free
                        installation, suggesting that bundling free installation
                        with future products may be a good way to increase
                        adoption.&nbsp; Using the small subset of household who
                        adopted this technology, we find that this device
                        decreases the time spent collection water for adults,
                        but not for children.&nbsp; We also do not find that
                        this device leads to meaningful reallocations of time
                        use.&nbsp; We find weak evidence that adults replace the
                        time they save on water collection with other unpaid
                        work.<br>
