                    <span class="bodytext">Diarrheal diseases, linked to poor household
                    access to safe drinking water, are the third leading cause of infant
                    mortality worldwide, accounting for about 20% of deaths among
                    children under five years of age. Both the disease burden and
                    socio-economic costs of poor access to water falls disproportionately
                    on women and children, who are typically responsible for collecting
                    water in developing countries.&nbsp; According to the FAO, women
                    spent up to 8 hours per day collecting water in some parts of
                    Africa.&nbsp; Access to sufficient quantities of water that is
                    uncontaminated and potable is a significant development challenge.
                    Indeed, the sole quantitative environmental target in the United
                    Nations Millennium Development Goals is the call to &ldquo;reduce by
                    half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe
                    drinking water.&rdquo;</span><br class="bodytext" />

                    <span class="bodytext">A newly developed rainwater storage device
                    (RSD) introduced in Uganda by Relief International offers a promising
                    technological solution to the twin problems of lack of access to
                    water in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality. Water of
                    inadequate quantity and quality hinders human capabilities throughout
                    the developing world, and the success of the rainwater storage device
                    can therefore have welfare consequences of global scale.&nbsp;
                    However, new technologies are only useful to the extent that they are
                    affordable for and acceptable to the intended beneficiaries. Low
                    demand for many different types of technologies seemingly capable of
                    increasing welfare is a central puzzle in development. Salient
                    examples span sectors, ranging from agricultural inputs (high-yield
                    seed varieties and fertilizer) to household health technologies
                    (insecticide-treated bed-nets and point-of-use drinking water
                    treatments).</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">With this potential technological solution in
                    place, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to gauge</span>
                    <span class="bodytext">the demand-side responsiveness to that
                    technology in order to: (a) determine what the potential size of the
                    market for the Relief International rainwater storage device might
                    be, (b) identify price points the market can sustain, (c) identify
                    the most effective marketing strategies to promote adoption, and (d)
                    determine whether we can effectively use information dissemination
                    through social networks and other related &lsquo;social
                    marketing&rsquo; concepts to create commercial demand for the new
                    product.&nbsp; Moreover, since demand for rainwater storage devices
                    may be attenuated through some important demand-side externalities
                    (e.g. women and children in charge of water collection and most
                    susceptible to water-borne illnesses may be the primary beneficiaries
                    of the new technology, but unfortunately, they may lack
                    decision-making authority over household expenditures), we also use
                    this RCT to measure any social welfare gains from the new
                    technology.&nbsp; Quantifying the social benefits in terms of the
                    reduced time allocation requirement to water collection (which frees
                    up women and children&rsquo;s time for labor force participation and
                    schooling) or a reduced incidence of diseases associated with
                    consuming contaminated water can help us determine whether the social
                    cost-benefit calculation justifies spending resources on any
                    marketing intervention that helps develop sustainable demand for the
                    product.&nbsp; Before asking the development community to invest
                    resources in this technology, we must develop some comparative sense
                    of costs and returns to rainwater harvesting relative to spring
                    protection, point-of-use drinking water treatments, chlorinated piped
                    water systems and the like.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">&nbsp;</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">In the implementation phase, we randomly
                    varied the incentives and marketing conditions associated with the
                    sale of rainwater storage devices to different households and
                    different villages. We experimentally varied the price for the device
                    by offering discount vouchers to random subsets of households.&nbsp;
                    Variation in prices will allow us to trace out a demand curve for the
                    product, and will also create random variation in adoption decisions
                    that can be used to causally identify the socio-economic consequences
                    of rainwater harvesting in follow up surveys.&nbsp; We also
                    randomized the marketing schemes across the different villages, to
                    test the effectiveness of (say) offering free installation to the
                    first group of users. Proper installation and use by lead adopters
                    may be independently important for the &ldquo;right type of
                    information&rdquo; to permeate through social networks about the
                    value of the device.&nbsp;</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">Our preliminary results suggest that the
                    demand for this product at market prices is extremely low.&nbsp; One
                    promising result from this research is that consumers in this
                    low-income context seem to highly value free installation, suggesting
                    that bundling free installation with future products may be a good
                    way to increase adoption.&nbsp; Using the small subset of household
                    who adopted this technology, we find that this device decreases the
                    time spent collection water for adults, but not for children.&nbsp;
                    We also do not find that this device leads to meaningful
                    reallocations of time use.&nbsp; We find weak evidence that adults
                    replace the time they save on water collection with other unpaid
                    work.</span><br />
