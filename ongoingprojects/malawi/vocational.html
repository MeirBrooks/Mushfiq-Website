Differences in the Impact of Vocational Training on Malawi's Youth</span><br>
<p class="subheading">Project Summary&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bodytext">Jo</span><span class="bodytext">b training programs have been recognized as
effective policy tools to provide youth with marketable labor market
skills. In Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, vocational and
entrepreneurial training is even more important given that over 80
percent of the population is self-employed in small business and
household enterprises. In 2009, the Government of Malawi decided to
pilot a new apprenticeship program aimed at vulnerable youth (mainly
orphans or school dropouts) to address employability issues, promote
productive self-employment and reduce vulnerability to risky sexual
behavior.&nbsp; </span><br class="bodytext">
</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="bodytext"> Evidence
from our randomized controlled trial of this intervention suggests that
the training did not increase labor market outcomes in the short run
but did results in skill development, continued investment in human
capital, and improved well-being, with more positive effects for
men.&nbsp; We find that women make decisions in a more constrained
environment, and their participation is affected by family obligations.
Participation is also more expensive for women, resulting in a worse
training experience.&nbsp; </span><br class="bodytext">
<br class="bodytext">
<span class="bodytext">Additionally, we
conduct an analysis of the determinants and
consequences of dropout by tracking a large fraction of program
dropouts.&nbsp; Having friends or relatives nearby the training
center is a strong predictor of whether trainees - both male and female
- can complete the training.&nbsp; Women are more likely to stick
with the training program when their opportunities costs decrease (e.g.
they lose a job in the pre-study period).&nbsp; Using
non-experimental data on dropout decisions, we provide suggestive
evidence that dropouts from the training program are similar to those
in the control group at follow-up, suggesting that they simply forgo
the benefits of the program by dropping out.</span><br>
