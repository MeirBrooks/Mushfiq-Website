                        This project adds to the literature surrounding the
                        current debate on the contribution of foreign students
                        to the U.S. and their effect on native wages in both low
                        and high-skilled labor.&nbsp; Current research
                        demonstrates that despite deficiencies in math and
                        science training among American secondary school
                        students, the United States has sustained its primary
                        position as a developer of new scientific knowledge,
                        arguably as a result of foreign doctoral students.&nbsp;
                        This project addresses the gap in current research that
                        demonstrates a correlation between the highest-caliber
                        graduate students from around the world and high-quality
                        research and productivity (measured by the number of
                        articles published, the frequency by which they are
                        cited, and patent applications).</span><br>

                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> In
                        order to test the hypothesis that foreign students are
                        important contributors to knowledge creation in U.S.
                        universities, this project looks at the relationship
                        between the role and productivity of foreign students
                        using U.S. economy panel data of 2300 science and
                        engineering departments at 100 large American
                        universities from 1973 to 1998.&nbsp; This project
                        addresses the possibility that correlation between
                        enrollment and productivity could be attributed to
                        omitted variables, including increases in foreign
                        applications due to an improvement in faculty quality or
                        greater funding and decreases in foreign applications
                        due to an increase in American students, by isolating
                        potential causal impacts through the use of an
                        instrumental variables strategy.&nbsp; The research uses
                        fluctuations in foreign students’ applications to a
                        specific department in U.S. institutions as a result of
                        macroeconomic shocks and policy changes in source
                        countries to isolate changes in publishing within that
                        academic department.</span><br>
                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">
                        &nbsp;</span><br>
                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> The
                        findings show that foreign doctoral students
                        significantly and positively influence publications and
                        citations produced by U.S. academic departments; a 10%
                        reduction in the foreign-student share would have
                        reduced citations and publications by 5-6% in the
                        average department over our time period.&nbsp; However,
                        a larger share of foreign students has an adverse effect
                        on high-quality scientific achievement of academic
                        departments, demonstrating that it is the diversity
                        which leads to higher quality research output in
                        collaborative fields.&nbsp; The findings show that a
                        diverse student classroom allows for the exchange and
                        mixing of both complementary and heterogeneous skills
                        and encourages cross-country research collaborations.
                        Diversity demonstrated a large positive and significant
                        effect on publications and citations, with a 10%
                        increase in diversity correlating with a 10% rise in
                        both publications and citations, and the replacement of
                        one in twenty American students with a foreigner leading
                        to at least 2.77 more publications.&nbsp; This analysis
                        adds to the existing literature by documenting the key
                        benefits of high-skilled immigration in the U.S.—a
                        country that relies heavily on innovation for growth—and
                        perhaps will be useful in the future in thinking about
                        the student-immigration policy debate.</span><br>
