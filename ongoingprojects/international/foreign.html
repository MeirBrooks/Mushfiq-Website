<p><span class="subheading">Project
Summary</span><br>
</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="bodytext"> This project adds to the literature
surrounding the current debate on the contribution of foreign students
to the U.S. and their effect on native wages in both low and
high-skilled labor.&nbsp; Current research demonstrates that
despite deficiencies in math and science training among American
secondary school students, the United States has sustained its primary
position as a developer of new scientific knowledge, arguably as a
result of foreign doctoral students.&nbsp; This project addresses
the gap in current research that demonstrates a correlation between the
highest-caliber graduate students from around the world and
high-quality research and productivity (measured by the number of
articles published, the frequency by which they are cited, and patent
applications).</span><br class="bodytext">
<span class="bodytext"> &nbsp;</span><br class="bodytext">
<span class="bodytext"> In order to test the
hypothesis that foreign students are important contributors to
knowledge creation in U.S. universities, this project looks at the
relationship between the role and productivity of foreign students
using U.S. economy panel data of 2300 science and engineering
departments at 100 large American universities from 1973 to
1998.&nbsp; This project addresses the possibility that correlation
between enrollment and productivity could be attributed to omitted
variables, including increases in foreign applications due to an
improvement in faculty quality or greater funding and decreases in
foreign applications due to an increase in American students, by
isolating potential causal impacts through the use of an instrumental
variables strategy.&nbsp; The research uses fluctuations in foreign
students’ applications to a specific department in U.S. institutions as
a result of macroeconomic shocks and policy changes in source countries
to isolate changes in publishing within that academic department.</span><br class="bodytext">
<span class="bodytext"> &nbsp;</span><br class="bodytext">
<span class="bodytext"> The findings show that
foreign doctoral students significantly and positively influence
publications and citations produced by U.S. academic departments; a 10%
reduction in the foreign-student share would have reduced citations and
publications by 5-6% in the average department over our time
period.&nbsp; However, a larger share of foreign students has an
adverse effect on high-quality scientific achievement of academic
departments, demonstrating that it is the diversity which leads to
higher quality research output in collaborative fields.&nbsp; The
findings show that a diverse student classroom allows for the exchange
and mixing of both complementary and heterogeneous skills and
encourages cross-country research collaborations. Diversity
demonstrated a large positive and significant effect on publications
and citations, with a 10% increase in diversity correlating with a 10%
rise in both publications and citations, and the replacement of one in
twenty American students with a foreigner leading to at least 2.77 more
publications.&nbsp; This analysis adds to the existing literature
by documenting the key benefits of high-skilled immigration in the
U.S.—a country that relies heavily on innovation for growth—and perhaps
will be useful in the future in thinking about the student-immigration
policy debate.</span><br>
