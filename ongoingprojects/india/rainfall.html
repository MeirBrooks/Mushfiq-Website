                  <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    <span class="bodytext">Agricultural activity is inherently risky, and
                    smoothing consumption across years or seasons is a significant
                    challenge for agrarian households in developing countries. Farmers
                    and entrepreneurs in rural agrarian economies therefore should have
                    high demand for credit and insurance services, but the option to
                    purchase such services often does not exist.&nbsp; Institutional
                    innovations that lower the cost of loans have led to thriving
                    microcredit enterprises in certain areas, but farmers still largely
                    resort to informal alternatives &#8211; insuring each other through
                    gifts and loans, forward-selling labor to landowners at high implicit
                    interest rates &#8211; to cope with risks associated with pest or
                    drought-induced harvest failure or price volatility in commodities
                    markets.&nbsp; Surprisingly, rainfall insurance markets do not
                    function well even in areas where farmers face large weather
                    risks.&nbsp; Recent studies show that take-up rates are extremely low
                    even when actuarially-fair rainfall insurance contracts are
                    offered.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">There are several possible explanations for
                    the observed low demand for formal insurance products: (a) liquidity
                    constrained households cannot afford premiums, (b) insurance products
                    are too complex for uneducated farmers, (c) farmers do not trust the
                    insurance seller to make the promised pay-outs, or (d) farmers are
                    already implicitly insured through informal networks or through
                    limited liability credit contracts, which in turn limits their demand
                    for a formal insurance product.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">This IGC-funded research project seeks to
                    understand why Indian farmers exposed to rainfall risk are reluctant
                    to purchase formal insurance products that mitigate those risks. Our
                    approach combines exogenous natural variation in informal insurance
                    among Indian farmers (based on their membership in a sub-caste-based
                    risk-sharing network), with designed (randomized) variation in the
                    insurance contract offered. The randomized design component of the
                    project will help identify the causal effects of liquidity (or credit
                    or savings) constraints in explaining low take-up rates. On the other
                    hand, marketing to farmers from different sub-castes or jatis who are
                    differentially indemnified through their informal risk-sharing
                    networks will help identify whether farmers are reluctant to purchase
                    formal insurance contracts simply because they are already informally
                    insured.</span><br class="bodytext" />

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="bodytext">The Interaction
                    Between Informal Risk Sharing &amp; Index Insurance</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">We show in a simple model incorporating
                    cooperative informal risk sharing and index insurance subject to
                    basis risk (i.e. mismatches between the rainfall-index-based payouts
                    and the actual losses incurred by the policy holders) that formal
                    insurance products and informal risk sharing networks interact in the
                    market in ways that depend upon the type of informal indemnification
                    and the extent of basis risk afflicting the index-based insurance
                    product.&nbsp; When the formal insurance product is imperfect due to
                    basis risk, informal risk sharing, by covering household losses that
                    are the consequence of basis risk, may enhance the benefits from
                    formal index insurance contracts.&nbsp; Thus, the index contract
                    increases risk-taking in constant to informal risk-sharing networks,
                    which may reduce risk-taking if the network primarily indemnifies
                    against idiosyncratic risk.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">Using a combination of non-experimental and
                    experimental survey data from rural India, we find that sub-castes
                    both compensate for individual losses and pay out on the basis of
                    village-level rainfall shocks.&nbsp; We also find empricially that
                    basis risk, as measured by the perceived distance of the respondent
                    to the nearest rainfall station, is a significant impediment to the
                    take-up of the index insurance product.&nbsp; However, the negative
                    effect of basis risk is attenuated for households in sub-castes that
                    more successfully indemnify individual losses.&nbsp; Households in
                    sub-castes that already informally provide insurance coverage based
                    on aggregate shocks on the other hand are less likely to purchase the
                    index product. Thus, our findings indicate that informal insurance is
                    both a complement to formal index insurance and a substitute,
                    depending on basis risk and the nature of the informal insurance
                    arrangement.</span><br class="bodytext" />

                    Insurance</span></span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">In the course of marketing insurance products
                    for the randomized experiment component of this project, we found
                    that agricultural laborers, whose livelihoods are weather dependent,
                    demonstrate as strong a demand for weather index insurance as
                    cultivating landowners. Strikingly, landless laborers currently do
                    not have access to index insurance markets because regulatory
                    restrictions in India prevent the sale of such contracts to
                    non-cultivators. Laborers are less susceptible to basis risk, and the
                    relative demand for index insurance is particularly strong among this
                    group compared with cultivator households in villages that are
                    farther away from rainfall stations.</span><br class="bodytext" />

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="bodytext">General Equilibrium
                    Effects</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">Consistent with the theoretical predictions of
                    a general-equilibrium model of wage setting with weather risk, we
                    find that both labor demand and equilibrium wages become more
                    rainfall sensitive when cultivators are offered rainfall insurance,
                    because insurance induces cultivators to switch to riskier,
                    higher-yield production methods. The same insurance contract offered
                    to agricultural laborers smoothes wages across rainfall states by
                    reducing labor supply during droughts (when insurance payouts occur).
                    Policy simulations based on our estimates suggest that selling
                    insurance only to land-owning cultivators (which is the current
                    regulatory practice in India and other developing countries) makes
                    wage laborers worse off in some states of the world due to the
                    increase in wage volatility, relative to a situation where insurance
                    does not exist at all. Marketing insurance to both cultivators and
                    the landless eliminates this adverse effect on the landless, and
                    mildly increases average wages compared to a regime of no
                    insurance.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">These findings also yield a clear policy
                    message &#8211; the current practice of designing insurance contracts
                    on the basis of owned acreage, and marketing products only to landed
                    cultivators likely reduces the welfare of the landless. These
                    unintended spillovers create a more risky economic environment for
                    those who have to rely exclusively on their own labor for their
                    livelihoods. The problem is compounded because this same population
                    is also denied the possibility of insurance coverage. Our
                    general-equilibrium analysis highlights this adverse spillover effect
                    on a non-treated population, but our experimental design and
                    simulations also allows us to show that the problem can be addressed
                    by expanding insurance coverage for this population.</span><br />
