                        Agricultural activity is inherently risky, and smoothing
                        consumption across years or seasons is a significant
                        challenge for agrarian households in developing
                        countries. Farmers and entrepreneurs in rural agrarian
                        economies therefore should have high demand for credit
                        and insurance services, but the option to purchase such
                        services often does not exist.&nbsp; Institutional
                        innovations that lower the cost of loans have led to
                        thriving microcredit enterprises in certain areas, but
                        farmers still largely resort to informal alternatives –
                        insuring each other through gifts and loans,
                        forward-selling labor to landowners at high implicit
                        interest rates – to cope with risks associated with pest
                        or drought-induced harvest failure or price volatility
                        in commodities markets.&nbsp; Surprisingly, rainfall
                        insurance markets do not function well even in areas
                        where farmers face large weather risks.&nbsp; Recent
                        studies show that take-up rates are extremely low even
                        when actuarially-fair rainfall insurance contracts are
                        offered. </span><br>

                        There are several possible explanations for the observed
                        low demand for formal insurance products: (a) liquidity
                        constrained households cannot afford premiums, (b)
                        insurance products are too complex for uneducated
                        farmers, (c) farmers do not trust the insurance seller
                        to make the promised pay-outs, or (d) farmers are
                        already implicitly insured through informal networks or
                        through limited liability credit contracts, which in
                        turn limits their demand for a formal insurance product.</span><br>

                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> This
                        IGC-funded research project seeks to understand why
                        Indian farmers exposed to rainfall risk are reluctant to
                        purchase formal insurance products that mitigate those
                        risks. Our approach combines exogenous natural variation
                        in informal insurance among Indian farmers (based on
                        their membership in a sub-caste-based risk-sharing
                        network), with designed (randomized) variation in the
                        insurance contract offered. The randomized design
                        component of the project will help identify the causal
                        effects of liquidity (or credit or savings) constraints
                        in explaining low take-up rates. On the other hand,
                        marketing to farmers from different sub-castes or jatis
                        who are differentially indemnified through their
                        informal risk-sharing networks will help identify
                        whether farmers are reluctant to purchase formal
                        insurance contracts simply because they are already
                        informally insured.<br>

                          Informal Risk Sharing &amp; Index Insurance</strong><br>
                        We show in a simple model incorporating cooperative
                        informal risk sharing and index insurance subject to
                        basis risk (i.e. mismatches between the
                        rainfall-index-based payouts and the actual losses
                        incurred by the policy holders) that formal insurance
                        products and informal risk sharing networks interact in
                        the market in ways that depend upon the type of informal
                        indemnification and the extent of basis risk afflicting
                        the index-based insurance product.&nbsp; When the formal
                        insurance product is imperfect due to basis risk,
                        informal risk sharing, by covering household losses that
                        are the consequence of basis risk, may enhance the
                        benefits from formal index insurance contracts.&nbsp;
                        Thus, the index contract increases risk-taking in
                        constant to informal risk-sharing networks, which may
                        reduce risk-taking if the network primarily indemnifies
                        against idiosyncratic risk.<br>

                          style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">Using a
                          combination of non-experimental and experimental
                          survey data from rural India, we find that sub-castes
                          both compensate for individual losses and pay out on
                          the basis of village-level rainfall shocks.&nbsp; We
                          also find empricially that basis risk, as measured by
                          the perceived distance of the respondent to the
                          nearest rainfall station, is a significant impediment
                          to the take-up of the index insurance product.&nbsp;
                          However, the negative effect of basis risk is
                          attenuated for households in sub-castes that more
                          successfully indemnify individual losses.&nbsp;
                          Households in sub-castes that already informally
                          provide insurance coverage based on aggregate shocks
                          on the other hand are less likely to purchase the
                          index product. Thus, our findings indicate that
                          informal insurance is both a complement to formal
                          index insurance and a substitute, depending on basis
                          risk and the nature of the informal insurance
                          arrangement.<br>

                        In the course of marketing insurance products for the
                        randomized experiment component of this project, we
                        found that agricultural laborers, whose livelihoods are
                        weather dependent, demonstrate as strong a demand for
                        weather index insurance as cultivating landowners.
                        Strikingly, landless laborers currently do not have
                        access to index insurance markets because regulatory
                        restrictions in India prevent the sale of such contracts
                        to non-cultivators. Laborers are less susceptible to
                        basis risk, and the relative demand for index insurance
                        is particularly strong among this group compared with
                        cultivator households in villages that are farther away
                        from rainfall stations.<br>

                      </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">Consistent
                        with the theoretical predictions of a
                        general-equilibrium model of wage setting with weather
                        risk, we find that both labor demand and equilibrium
                        wages become more rainfall sensitive when cultivators
                        are offered rainfall insurance, because insurance
                        induces cultivators to switch to riskier, higher-yield
                        production methods. The same insurance contract offered
                        to agricultural laborers smoothes wages across rainfall
                        states by reducing labor supply during droughts (when
                        insurance payouts occur). Policy simulations based on
                        our estimates suggest that selling insurance only to
                        land-owning cultivators (which is the current regulatory
                        practice in India and other developing countries) makes
                        wage laborers worse off in some states of the world due
                        to the increase in wage volatility, relative to a
                        situation where insurance does not exist at all.
                        Marketing insurance to both cultivators and the landless
                        eliminates this adverse effect on the landless, and
                        mildly increases average wages compared to a regime of
                        no insurance.<br>
                        <br>
                        These findings also yield a clear policy message – the
                        current practice of designing insurance contracts on the
                        basis of owned acreage, and marketing products only to
                        landed cultivators likely reduces the welfare of the
                        landless. These unintended spillovers create a more
                        risky economic environment for those who have to rely
                        exclusively on their own labor for their livelihoods.
                        The problem is compounded because this same population
                        is also denied the possibility of insurance coverage.
                        Our general-equilibrium analysis highlights this adverse
                        spillover effect on a non-treated population, but our
                        experimental design and simulations also allows us to
                        show that the problem can be addressed by expanding
                        insurance coverage for this population. </span><br>
