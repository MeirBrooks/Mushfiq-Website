                        The importance of fish markets in Bangladesh has
                        continued to grow in recent years.&nbsp; Currently 3
                        percent of Bangladeshis (7 percent of total employment)
                        work in the fishery sector, comprising of 6 percent of
                        GDP (Bangladeshi National Resources Institute,
                        2005).&nbsp; Studies show that aquaculture provides at
                        least 43 percent higher income than a hectare of land
                        under crop cultivation, thereby encouraging research to
                        further increase aquaculture productivity (Hasan &amp;
                        Talukder, 2004).&nbsp; Communally managed small-scale
                        water-bodies (jalmahals) are therefore of increasing
                        interest in Bangladesh.&nbsp; Approximately 13,003 of
                        these water-bodies are leased out for one to three years
                        by the Bangladeshi government to community based fishery
                        management projects that require active participation of
                        fisherman in the management process (Mustafa &amp;
                        Brooks, 2009).&nbsp; Anecdotal evidence suggests that
                        some community groups are better than others at
                        overcoming collective action problems inherent in
                        maintaining common property resources such as a water
                        body.</span><br class="bodytext">

                      <span class="bodytext">
                        While in the past these water-bodies were traditionally
                        sold to the highest bidder (local businessmen with
                        access to the necessary funds but whom are most
                        concerned with maximizing profit by paying fisherman low
                        wages), the 1986 New Fishery Management Policy gave a
                        preference to cooperatives made of “genuine”
                        fisherman.&nbsp; Under such tightly knit cooperatives
                        financial risk and investment is equally shared, thereby
                        encouraging combined effort and discouraging overuse. </span><br class="bodytext">

                      <span class="bodytext"> This
                        project will allow us to collect data from 400
                        communities in order to better understand why some of
                        these collectively run fisheries are better managed, in
                        order to determine where improved fish feed would have
                        the greatest potential impact.&nbsp; We expect that the
                        information we gain will be applicable not just to the
                        study of fisheries, but also to other situations where
                        communities must work collectively to provide and
                        maintain public goods, in the absence of government
                        provision or enforcement of property rights. It is also
                        significant because it will allow us to better
                        understand the potential impacts of improved fish feed
                        on fish farming in Bangladesh, to be used in a follow-up
                        study.&nbsp; That is, there is potential for newly
                        developed fish feed to greatly improve fishing yields,
                        and correspondingly, profits for fishermen, but this
                        benefit will only accrue to water-bodies whose
                        management is capable of solving the collective action
                        issues needed to purchase feed and provide complimentary
                        inputs.&#8194;</span><br>
