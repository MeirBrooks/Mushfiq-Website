                    <span class="bodytext">An estimated 1,000 million people live in
                    countries where 20-50+% of all marriages are contracted between
                    couples related (generally second cousins or closer).&nbsp; This
                    estimate is deliberately conservative, since in many of the most
                    populous countries, such as Indonesia and Bangladesh, very few
                    studies have attempted to determine the current prevalence of
                    consanguinity or its effects on population health. In an earlier
                    household-based survey of the Teknaf region of Bangladesh, located in
                    the extreme southeast of the country, which borders Myanmar, 17.6% of
                    marriages were consanguineous.&nbsp; However, there is limited
                    literature that adequately accounts for the possibility of non-random
                    selection into consanguinity for families with socio-economic
                    characteristics that may also pre-dispose them towards a certain
                    morbidity profile.&nbsp; Given the confounding factors associated
                    with consanguineous marriage and poor health, including poverty and
                    lack of child immunization, the present multidisciplinary study was
                    undertaken to investigate these social and economic influences on
                    consanguineous marriage, and the survival and health effects of
                    children born to such couples.</span><br class="bodytext" />

                    <span class="bodytext">The situation was assessed in a retrospective

                    socio-economic characteristics, specific health outcomes during
                    pregnancy, infancy, and from 1-15 years was collected in 2006.&nbsp;
                    Using instrumental variables techniques that account for the fact
                    that consanguineous marriages are only possible if a biological
                    relative of the right gender and age is available, quasi-random
                    variation in the incidence of first cousin marriages were generated
                    to isolate the causal effect of consanguinity.&nbsp;</span><br />

                        Abstract: This paper uses a wealth shock from the construction of
                        a flood protection embankment in rural Bangladesh coupled with
                        data on the universe of all 52,000 marriage decisions between
                        1982 and 1996 to examine changes in marital prospects for
                        households protected by the embankment relative to unprotected
                        households living on the other side of the river. We use
                        difference-in-difference specifications to document that brides
                        from protected households commanded larger dowries, married
                        wealthier households, and became less likely to marry biological
                        relatives. Financial liquidity-constrained households appear to
                        use within-family marriage (in which one can promise ex-post
                        payments) as a form of credit to meet up-front dowry demands, but
                        the resultant wealth shock for households protected by the
                        embankment relaxed this need to marry consanguineously. Our
                        results shed light on the socioeconomic roots of consanguinity,
                        which carries health risks for offspring but can also carry
                        substantial benefits for the families involved.
