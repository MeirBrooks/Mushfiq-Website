                    <p><span class="subheading">Project Summary</span></p>
                    <div style="text-align: justify;"> <span class="bodytext">An
                        estimated 1,000 million people live in countries where
                        20-50+% of all marriages are contracted between couples
                        related (generally second cousins or closer).  This
                        estimate is deliberately conservative, since in many of
                        the most populous countries, such as Indonesia and
                        Bangladesh, very few studies have attempted
                        to determine the current prevalence of consanguinity or
                        its effects on population health. In an earlier
                        household-based survey of the Teknaf region of
                        Bangladesh, located in the extreme southeast of the
                        country, which borders Myanmar, 17.6% of marriages were
                        consanguineous.  However, there is limited literature
                        that adequately accounts for the possibility of
                        non-random selection into consanguinity for families
                        with socio-economic characteristics that may also
                        pre-dispose them towards a certain morbidity profile. 
                        Given the confounding factors associated with
                        consanguineous marriage and poor health, including
                        poverty and lack of child immunization, the present
                        multidisciplinary study was undertaken to investigate
                        these social and economic influences on consanguineous
                        marriage, and the survival and health effects of
                        children born to such couples.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                      <br class="bodytext" />
                      <span class="bodytext">The situation was assessed in a
                        retrospective survey of 5,208 pregnancies reported by
                        306 first cousin and 305 non-consanguineous marriages in
                        which detailed information on socio-economic
                        characteristics, specific health outcomes during
                        pregnancy, infancy, and from 1-15 years was collected in
                        2006.  Using instrumental variables techniques that
                        account for the fact that consanguineous marriages are
                        only possible if a biological relative of the right
                        gender and age is available, quasi-random variation in
                        the incidence of first cousin marriages were generated
                        to isolate the causal effect of consanguinity. </span><br />

                          Abstract: This paper uses a wealth shock from the
                          construction of a flood protection embankment in rural
                          Bangladesh coupled with data on the universe of all
                          52,000 marriage decisions between 1982 and 1996 to
                          examine changes in marital prospects for households
                          protected by the embankment relative to unprotected
                          households living on the other side of the river. We
                          use difference-in-difference specifications to
                          document that brides from protected households
                          commanded larger dowries, married wealthier
                          households, and became less likely to marry biological
                          relatives. Financial liquidity-constrained households
                          appear to use within-family marriage (in which one can
                          promise ex-post payments) as a form of credit to meet
                          up-front dowry demands, but the resultant wealth shock
                          for households protected by the embankment relaxed
                          this need to marry consanguineously. Our results shed
                          light on the socioeconomic roots of consanguinity,
                          which carries health risks for offspring but can also
                          carry substantial benefits for the families involved.
