                  <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    <span class="bodytext">Like many other developing countries,
                    Bangladesh is rapidly urbanizing.&nbsp; Dhaka city, which now
                    accounts for a quarter of the country&rsquo;s GDP, has been a main
                    locus of urban growth.&nbsp; However, tax revenue collection has not
                    kept pace with rapid urbanization, resulting in poor or nonexistent
                    public services.&nbsp; Low rates of electrification and the poor
                    quality of the roads are now frequently mentioned by the government
                    and the private sector as major constraints on further economic
                    growth.&nbsp; Thus a major priority for the government of Bangladesh
                    is to increase the number of taxpayers and revenue collection in the
                    country.&nbsp; In the context of VAT, many firms remain unregistered,
                    and even among those that are registered, only 16% actually file
                    monthly VAT returns.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">Traditional methods of improving tax
                    compliance have generally relied on &ldquo;stick&rdquo; or
                    punishment-based methods: audits coupled with penalties for
                    non-compliant firms.&nbsp; Such audits may be costly and subject to
                    opportunities for corruption.&nbsp; In addition, it may be difficult
                    for tax inspectors to assess the true tax liability of the firm even
                    conditional on performing an audit.&nbsp; An alternative strategy
                    would be to rely on reward-based methods.&nbsp; Easing registration
                    procedures, paying registration fees or providing financial
                    incentives conditional on registration and filing are examples of
                    inducements that could raise tax compliance.&nbsp; However, a recent
                    study in Sri Lanka (McKenzie and Woodruff, 2008) shows that such
                    strategies are not very successful once applied in the field.&nbsp; A
                    different type of reward strategy that has been successful in other
                    contexts involves leveraging the power of social recognition to
                    increase pro-social behavior.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">In collaboration with the Dhaka-South
                    Commissionerate of the Bangladesh National Board of Revenue (NBR), we
                    implemented a range of programs that attempt to exploit firms'
                    interest in social incentives and peer recognition to increase
                    voluntary tax compliance.&nbsp; We conducted our study as a
                    randomized controlled trial, where we tested the efficacy of various
                    information treatments on tax compliance and payment.
                    &nbsp;</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">We implemented our interventions through
                    letters to each of the 16,000 firms in our sample.&nbsp; Prior to the
                    delivery of the letter, we digitized all registration and tax payment
                    data so that we could include detailed information about each firms'
                    registration and payment information.&nbsp; In addition, this
                    exercise allowed us to demonstrate to firms that NBR can match tax
                    information to firms, giving credibility to the interventions.&nbsp;
                    Finally, we assigned randomly assigned geographic clusters of firms
                    to receive zone, one, two or all three of the following information
                    interventions on their letter:</span><br class="bodytext" />

                    <ol class="bodytext">
                      <li>Baseline Information: Firms assigned to this treatment received
                      additional information on the aggregate registration, filing and
                      payment rates of the cluster in the previous period.</li>

                      <li>Recognition Cards: Firms in this treatment group were told that
                      they would be eligible to receive a gold, silver or bronze
                      recognition card based on their tax compliance and their cluster's
                      tax compliance.</li>

                      <li>Peer Group Information: Firms assigned to this treatment were
                      told their tax compliance behavior would be shared with other firms
                      in their cluster in a subsequent letter.</li>
                    </ol><span class="bodytext">Our results suggest that in clusters
                    where some firms are already paying their taxes (&gt;15%), the
                    promise of exposing information about all firms' tax payment behavior
                    led to a positive behavioral response and an increase in tax
                    compliance, especially among firms who had not paid in the previous
                    year.&nbsp; We did not find any increases in tax compliance or
                    payment stemming from the baseline information or recognition cards
                    treatment.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">Our findings indicate that firms pay attention
                    to peer recognition letters and react in ways predicted by simple
                    economic theory.&nbsp; Firms who are deviating from the norm of some
                    tax payments in their cluster, and therefore at the greatest risk of
                    a "negative" information revelation relative to their peers react
                    strongly to this intervention.&nbsp; This suggests there is a
                    significant potential for improving tax compliance and revenue
                    collection through peer information programs.</span><span style=
