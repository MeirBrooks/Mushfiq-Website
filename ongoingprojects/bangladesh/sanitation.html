                        One billion people, or about 15% of the world's
                        population, currently practice open defecation, and
                        another 1.5 billion do not have access to an improved
                        sanitation facility (WHO/UNICEF 2014).&nbsp; The
                        prevalence of open defecation and unimproved sanitation
                        facilities imposes a high public health cost, even on
                        households that do not engage in open defecation, since
                        they are still exposed to fecal matter contaminants in
                        their food and water supply.&nbsp; Researchers suggest
                        that inadequate sanitation contributes to high rates of
                        diarrheal disease causing 20% of diarrhea-related deaths

                        In this project, we partnered with VERC and WaterAid
                        Bangladesh to design, implement and test a multitude of
                        marketing treatments intended to increase the purchase,
                        adoption and use of hygienic latrines.&nbsp; The result
                        was a large scale randomized controlled trial covering
                        over 18,000 households in about 380 communities designed
                        to understand the importance of financial and
                        information constraints, collective action problems and
                        the effectiveness of different marketing strategies that
                        counter these barriers to adoption.<br>
                        <br>
                        During this RCT we tested the efficacy of three main
                        interventions intended to increase hygienic latrine
                        ownership.&nbsp; The first intervention, the Latrine
                        Promotion Program (LPP), was designed to address any
                        lack of knowledge about he importance of sanitation and
                        to encourage community coordination to address
                        collective action problems.&nbsp; We based the LPP
                        intervention on the Community-Led Total Sanitation
                        (CLTS) model, but modified it to place a particular
                        focus on hygienic lattrines.&nbsp; The second
                        intervention, Latrine Suppy Agents (LSA), was designed
                        to address difficulties faced by households who are
                        willing and financially able to purchse a latrine, but
                        lack the technical knowledge to make an information
                        decision.&nbsp; We trained the&nbsp; LSA to provide
                        information on where to purchase latrine parts, how to
                        assess their quality and how to install and maintain a
                        latrine.&nbsp; The third intervention addressed
                        financial barriers to latrine adoption through
                        subsidies.&nbsp; Lottery winners received vouchers
                        redeemable for approximately 50% of the price of to
                        purchase and install a hygienic latrine.&nbsp; We also
                        varied the precentage of lottery participants drawn as
                        winners into three intensity groups: low (25% winners),
                        medium (50% winners) and high (75% winners).&nbsp; This
                        last level of random variation afforded us the ability
                        to examine collective action problems and spillover
                        effects in adoption decisions. <br>

                        Our results suggest that information alone is not the
                        key barrier to latrine adoption.&nbsp; The LPP and LSA
                        treatments did not increase adoption relative to the
                        control group.&nbsp; However, we did find that the
                        subsidy treatment had a large and significant impact on
                        latrine adoption.&nbsp; Even households that lost the
                        subsidy lottery but lived in a village assigned to the
                        subsidy treament were more likely to own a hygienic
                        latrine at follow-up.&nbsp; We also find that a
                        household's propensity to continue open defecation is
                        lower if more of their their neighbors got lucky and
                        received toilet vouchers. These results show that
                        households base their latrine purchasing and use
                        decisions in part on the contemporaneous decisions of
                        those around them, even controlling for the price they
                        personally face for a latrine.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        The presence of interlinked decision-making has specific
                        implications for the design of effective marketing and
                        latrine promotion strategies. Sanitation interventions
                        will be more cost-effective if they can identify the
                        relevant externality network, and target that group
                        jointly rather than each household individually.&nbsp;
                        Asking community members to make a joint investment
                        commitment is a good idea, but our results suggest that
                        this should be accompanied with subsidies targeted to
                        the poorest members of the community.&nbsp; Future
                        programs could further attempt to harness the interplay
                        between subsidies and interlinked decision-making by
                        combining financial incentives with a forum for
                        community cooperation.<br>

                        addition to the analysis of adoption and use of latrine,
                        we also studied the political economy responses to this
                        large scale intervention.&nbsp; The plausible argument
                        that aid undermines political accountability by making
                        it difficult for voters to distinguish between good and
                        bad leaders has gained traction in many policy
                        debates.&nbsp; In theory, large scale interventions have
                        the potential to change the perception of politicians if
                        the constituents attribute credit for non-government
                        programs to a politician.&nbsp; <br>
                        <br>
                        We take advantage of the scale of our intervention to
                        test if political accountability is easily undermined by
                        development aid.&nbsp; We find that constituents update
                        positively about their leaders after the arrival of an
                        externally financed development program only if the
                        source of the program is uncertain.&nbsp; However, </span><span

                          informing beneficiaries about who is responsible for
                          the program eliminates the excess credit that leaders
                          receive from aid programs. </span>These results
                        suggest that while politicians may attempt to take
                        credit for development programs, it is not easy for them
                        to do.&nbsp; <br>

                              latrines, 380 communities (18,254 households) in
                              rural Bangladesh were randomly assigned to
                              different sanitation marketing treatments:

                              proportion of households in a neighborhood that
                              received subsidies. Community motivation and
                              information alone did not increase households’
                              access to latrines. The supply-side intervention
                              alone did not increase access, except among the
                              richest quartile of the population. Providing
                              subsidies along with motivation and information
                              increased access and reduced open defecation.
                              Latrine ownership also increased among households

                              We study political economy responses to a large
                              scale intervention in Bangladesh, where four
                              sub-districts consisting of 100 villages (12,000
                              households) were randomly assigned to control,
                              information or subsidy treatments to encourage
                              investments in improved sanitation. In theory,
                              leaders may endogenously respond to large
                              interventions by changing their allocation of
                              effort, and their constituents’ views about the
                              leader may rationally change as a result. In one
                              intervention where the leaders’ role in program
                              allocation was not clear to constituents,
                              constituents appear to attribute credit to their
                              local leader for a randomly assigned program.
                              However, when subsidy assignment is clearly and
                              transparently random, the lottery winners do not
                              attribute any extra credit to the politician
                              relative to lottery losers. The theory can
                              rationalize these observations if we model
                              leaders’ actions and constituent reactions under
                              imperfect information about leader ability. A
                              third intervention returns to program villages to
                              inform a subset of subsidy recipients that the
                              program was run by NGOs using external funds. This
                              eliminates the excess credit that leaders received
                              from treated households after the first
                              intervention. These results suggest that while
                              politicians may try to take credit for development
                              programs, it is not easy for them do so. Political
                              accountability is not easily undermined by
                              development aid.</span></div>
