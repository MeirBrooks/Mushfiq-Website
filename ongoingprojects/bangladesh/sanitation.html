                        currently practice open defecation, and another 1.5
                        billion do not have access to an improved sanitation
                        facility (WHO/UNICEF 2014).&#160; The prevalence of open
                        defecation and unimproved sanitation facilities imposes
                        a high public health cost, even on households that do
                        not engage in open defecation, since they are still
                        exposed to fecal matter contaminants in their food and
                        water supply.&#160; Researchers suggest that inadequate

                        about 380 communities designed to understand the

                        efficacy of three main interventions intended to
                        increase hygienic latrine ownership.&#160; The first
                        intervention, the Latrine Promotion Program (LPP), was
                        designed to address any lack of knowledge about he
                        importance of sanitation and to encourage community
                        coordination to address collective action problems.&#160; We
                        based the LPP intervention on the Community-Led Total
                        Sanitation (CLTS) model, but modified it to place a
                        particular focus on hygienic lattrines.&#160; The second
                        intervention, Latrine Suppy Agents (LSA), was designed
                        to address difficulties faced by households who are
                        willing and financially able to purchse a latrine, but
                        lack the technical knowledge to make an information
                        decision.&#160; We trained the&#160; LSA to provide information on
                        where to purchase latrine parts, how to assess their
                        quality and how to install and maintain a latrine.&#160; The
                        third intervention addressed financial barriers to
                        latrine adoption through subsidies.&#160; Lottery winners
                        received vouchers redeemable for approximately 50% of
                        the price of to purchase and install a hygienic
                        latrine.&#160; We also varied the precentage of lottery
                        participants drawn as winners into three intensity
                        groups: low (25% winners), medium (50% winners) and high
                        (75% winners).&#160; This last level of random variation
                        afforded us the ability to examine collective action
                        problems and spillover effects in adoption decisions.</span><br />

                      <span class="bodytext">Our results suggest that
                        information alone is not the key barrier to latrine
                        adoption.&#160; The LPP and LSA treatments did not increase
                        adoption relative to the control group.&#160; However, we did
                        find that the subsidy treatment had a large and
                        significant impact on latrine adoption.&#160; Even households
                        that lost the subsidy lottery but lived in a village
                        assigned to the subsidy treament were more likely to own
                        a hygienic latrine at follow-up.&#160; We also find that a
                        household's propensity to continue open defecation is
                        lower if more of their their neighbors got lucky and
                        received toilet vouchers. These results show that
                        households base their latrine purchasing and use
                        decisions in part on the contemporaneous decisions of
                        those around them, even controlling for the price they
                        personally face for a latrine.&#160;</span><br class="bodytext" />

                      <span class="bodytext">The presence of interlinked
                        decision-making has specific implications for the design
                        of effective marketing and latrine promotion strategies.
                        Sanitation interventions will be more cost-effective if
                        they can identify the relevant externality network, and
                        target that group jointly rather than each household
                        individually.&#160; Asking community members to make a joint
                        investment commitment is a good idea, but our results
                        suggest that this should be accompanied with subsidies
                        targeted to the poorest members of the community.&#160;
                        Future programs could further attempt to harness the
                        interplay between subsidies and interlinked
                        decision-making by combining financial incentives with a

                      <span class="bodytext">In addition to the analysis of
                        adoption and use of latrine, we also studied the
                        political economy responses to this large scale
                        intervention.&#160; The plausible argument that aid
                        undermines political accountability by making it
                        difficult for voters to distinguish between good and bad
                        leaders has gained traction in many policy debates.&#160; In
                        theory, large scale interventions have the potential to
                        change the perception of politicians if the constituents
                        attribute credit for non-government programs to a
                        politician.&#160;</span><br class="bodytext" />
                      <br class="bodytext" />
                      <span class="bodytext">We take advantage of the scale of
                        our intervention to test if political accountability is
                        easily undermined by development aid.&#160; We find that
                        constituents update positively about their leaders after
                        the arrival of an externally financed development
                        program only if the source of the program is uncertain.&#160;
                        However, simply informing beneficiaries about who is
                        responsible for the program eliminates the excess credit
                        that leaders receive from aid programs. These results
                        suggest that while politicians may attempt to take
                        credit for development programs, it is not easy for them
                        to do.&#160;</span><br />

                            disagreement on what policies can increase
                            sanitation coverage. To measure the effects of
                            alternative policies on investment in hygienic
                            latrines, we assigned 380 communities in rural
                            Bangladesh to different marketing
                            treatments&#8212;community motivation and information;
                            subsidies; a supply-side market access intervention;
                            and a control&#8212;in a cluster-randomized trial.
                            Community motivation alone did not increase hygienic
                            latrine ownership (+1.6 percentage points, p=0.43),
                            nor did the supply-side intervention (+0.3
                            percentage points, p=.90). Subsidies to the majority
                            of the landless poor increased ownership among
                            subsidized households (+22.0 percentage points,

                            neighbors. Subsidies also reduced open defecation by
                            14 percentage points (p&lt;.001).</div>

                            Abstract: We study political economy responses to a
                            large scale intervention in Bangladesh, where four
                            sub-districts consisting of 100 villages (12,000
                            households) were randomly assigned to control,
                            information or subsidy treatments to encourage
                            investments in improved sanitation. In theory,
                            leaders may endogenously respond to large
                            interventions by changing their allocation of
                            effort, and their constituents&#8217; views about the
                            leader may rationally change as a result. In one
                            intervention where the leaders&#8217; role in program
                            allocation was not clear to constituents,
                            constituents appear to attribute credit to their
                            local leader for a randomly assigned program.
                            However, when subsidy assignment is clearly and
                            transparently random, the lottery winners do not
                            attribute any extra credit to the politician
                            relative to lottery losers. The theory can
                            rationalize these observations if we model leaders&#8217;
                            actions and constituent reactions under imperfect
                            information about leader ability. A third
                            intervention returns to program villages to inform a
                            subset of subsidy recipients that the program was
                            run by NGOs using external funds. This eliminates
                            the excess credit that leaders received from treated
                            households after the first intervention. These
                            results suggest that while politicians may try to
                            take credit for development programs, it is not easy
                            for them do so. Political accountability is not
                            easily undermined by development aid. </div>
