                    <span class="bodytext">One billion people, or about 15% of the
                    world's population, currently practice open defecation, and another
                    1.5 billion do not have access to an improved sanitation facility
                    (WHO/UNICEF 2014).&nbsp; The prevalence of open defecation and
                    unimproved sanitation facilities imposes a high public health cost,
                    even on households that do not engage in open defecation, since they
                    are still exposed to fecal matter contaminants in their food and
                    water supply.&nbsp; Researchers suggest that inadequate sanitation
                    contributes to high rates of diarrheal disease causing 20% of
                    diarrhea-related deaths - approximately 280,000 in 2012 alone
                    (Pr&uuml;ss-&Uuml;st&uuml;n et al. 2014).</span><br class=

                    <span class="bodytext">In this project, we partnered with VERC and
                    WaterAid Bangladesh to design, implement and test a multitude of
                    marketing treatments intended to increase the purchase, adoption and
                    use of hygienic latrines.&nbsp; The result was a large scale
                    randomized controlled trial covering over 18,000 households in about
                    380 communities designed to understand the importance of financial
                    and information constraints, collective action problems and the
                    effectiveness of different marketing strategies that counter these
                    barriers to adoption.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">During this RCT we tested the efficacy of
                    three main interventions intended to increase hygienic latrine
                    ownership.&nbsp; The first intervention, the Latrine Promotion
                    Program (LPP), was designed to address any lack of knowledge about he
                    importance of sanitation and to encourage community coordination to
                    address collective action problems.&nbsp; We based the LPP
                    intervention on the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) model, but
                    modified it to place a particular focus on hygienic lattrines.&nbsp;
                    The second intervention, Latrine Suppy Agents (LSA), was designed to
                    address difficulties faced by households who are willing and
                    financially able to purchse a latrine, but lack the technical
                    knowledge to make an information decision.&nbsp; We trained the&nbsp;
                    LSA to provide information on where to purchase latrine parts, how to
                    assess their quality and how to install and maintain a latrine.&nbsp;
                    The third intervention addressed financial barriers to latrine
                    adoption through subsidies.&nbsp; Lottery winners received vouchers
                    redeemable for approximately 50% of the price of to purchase and
                    install a hygienic latrine.&nbsp; We also varied the precentage of
                    lottery participants drawn as winners into three intensity groups:
                    low (25% winners), medium (50% winners) and high (75% winners).&nbsp;
                    This last level of random variation afforded us the ability to
                    examine collective action problems and spillover effects in adoption
                    decisions.</span><br />

                    <span class="bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Latrine Adoption
                    and Use Results</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">Our results suggest that information alone is
                    not the key barrier to latrine adoption.&nbsp; The LPP and LSA
                    treatments did not increase adoption relative to the control
                    group.&nbsp; However, we did find that the subsidy treatment had a
                    large and significant impact on latrine adoption.&nbsp; Even
                    households that lost the subsidy lottery but lived in a village
                    assigned to the subsidy treament were more likely to own a hygienic
                    latrine at follow-up.&nbsp; We also find that a household's
                    propensity to continue open defecation is lower if more of their
                    their neighbors got lucky and received toilet vouchers. These results
                    show that households base their latrine purchasing and use decisions
                    in part on the contemporaneous decisions of those around them, even
                    controlling for the price they personally face for a
                    latrine.&nbsp;</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">The presence of interlinked decision-making
                    has specific implications for the design of effective marketing and
                    latrine promotion strategies. Sanitation interventions will be more
                    cost-effective if they can identify the relevant externality network,
                    and target that group jointly rather than each household
                    individually.&nbsp; Asking community members to make a joint
                    investment commitment is a good idea, but our results suggest that
                    this should be accompanied with subsidies targeted to the poorest
                    members of the community.&nbsp; Future programs could further attempt
                    to harness the interplay between subsidies and interlinked
                    decision-making by combining financial incentives with a forum for
                    community cooperation.</span><br />

                    <span class="bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">The Political
                    Economy of Large Scale Interventions</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">In addition to the analysis of adoption and
                    use of latrine, we also studied the political economy responses to
                    this large scale intervention.&nbsp; The plausible argument that aid
                    undermines political accountability by making it difficult for voters
                    to distinguish between good and bad leaders has gained traction in
                    many policy debates.&nbsp; In theory, large scale interventions have
                    the potential to change the perception of politicians if the
                    constituents attribute credit for non-government programs to a
                    politician.&nbsp;</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">We take advantage of the scale of our
                    intervention to test if political accountability is easily undermined
                    by development aid.&nbsp; We find that constituents update positively
                    about their leaders after the arrival of an externally financed
                    development program only if the source of the program is
                    uncertain.&nbsp; However, simply informing beneficiaries about who is
                    responsible for the program eliminates the excess credit that leaders
                    receive from aid programs. These results suggest that while
                    politicians may attempt to take credit for development programs, it
                    is not easy for them to do.&nbsp;</span><br />

                          Abstract: To analyze the relative effectiveness of alternative
                          strategies to increase investments in latrines, 380 communities
                          (18,254 households) in rural Bangladesh were randomly assigned
                          to different sanitation marketing treatments: community
                          motivation and information, partial subsidies to purchase
                          hygienic latrines, and a supply-side market access
                          intervention. To estimate demand spillovers, we also randomized
                          the proportion of households in a neighborhood that received
                          subsidies. Community motivation and information alone did not
                          increase households&rsquo; access to latrines. The supply-side
                          intervention alone did not increase access, except among the
                          richest quartile of the population. Providing subsidies along
                          with motivation and information increased access and reduced
                          open defecation. Latrine ownership also increased among
                          households that lived in subsidy villages but were not offered
                          a subsidy. Furthermore, this increase was greater in
                          communities where a larger proportion of neighboring households
                          won vouchers. This pattern suggests the existence of a social
                          multiplier in sanitation<br />
                          investment.

                          Abstract: We study political economy responses to a large scale
                          intervention in Bangladesh, where four sub-districts consisting
                          of 100 villages (12,000 households) were randomly assigned to
                          control, information or subsidy treatments to encourage
                          investments in improved sanitation. In theory, leaders may
                          endogenously respond to large interventions by changing their
                          allocation of effort, and their constituents&rsquo; views about
                          the leader may rationally change as a result. In one
                          intervention where the leaders&rsquo; role in program
                          allocation was not clear to constituents, constituents appear
                          to attribute credit to their local leader for a randomly
                          assigned program. However, when subsidy assignment is clearly
                          and transparently random, the lottery winners do not attribute
                          any extra credit to the politician relative to lottery losers.
                          The theory can rationalize these observations if we model
                          leaders&rsquo; actions and constituent reactions under
                          imperfect information about leader ability. A third
                          intervention returns to program villages to inform a subset of
                          subsidy recipients that the program was run by NGOs using
                          external funds. This eliminates the excess credit that leaders
                          received from treated households after the first intervention.
                          These results suggest that while politicians may try to take
                          credit for development programs, it is not easy for them do so.
                          Political accountability is not easily undermined by
                          development aid.
