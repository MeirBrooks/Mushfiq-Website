                        Our research addresses the low uptake of improved
                        cookstoves in developing countries.&nbsp; Improved
                        stoves have positive health and environmental impacts by
                        reducing indoor air pollution (IAP).&nbsp; Biomass
                        combustion using traditional cookstoves is thought to be
                        the main contributor to IAP, a principal culprit of
                        acute respiratory infections in children
                        worldwide.&nbsp; Black carbon emission from traditional
                        cook-stoves is an important contributor to climate
                        change as well.&nbsp; Despite these hazards, half of the
                        world’s population continues to rely on traditional
                        biomass-burning stoves for cooking.</span><br>

                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">
                        Although simple technologies to reduce IAP exist,
                        efforts to promote the adoption of these “improved
                        cook-stoves” have proven ineffective.&nbsp; Governments
                        and international organizations have begun to take
                        notice of the issue – in 2010, the Global Alliance for
                        Clean Cookstoves was formed, with the goal of 100
                        million households adopting improved cookstoves by 2020.
                        With over $250 million in projected funding, it is
                        important to be able to effectively allocate spending to
                        target potential consumers.</span><br>
                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> </span><br>
                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> We
                        conducted a randomized controlled study of 3000
                        households in 60 villages in two rural districts in
                        Bangladesh to analyze improved cookstove adoption under
                        eight conditions.&nbsp; The study design allows us to
                        estimate the effectiveness of different interventions to
                        promote cookstove adoption through subsidies,
                        information about health benefits, marketing campaigns
                        aimed at women and men, and using social networks to
                        overcome aversions to changes in traditional behavior.</span><br>
                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> </span><br>
                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> Our
                        results suggest that global health practitioners need to
                        recognize that developing country consumers are utility
                        (rather than health) maximizers, and are already largely
                        aware of the hazards of indoor air pollution caused by
                        traditional cookstoves. Therefore, marketing which
                        focuses on highlighting these effects is likely to miss
                        the mark. Instead, marketing should be tailored to
                        address the specific demand-side aversions present in
                        the target market.</span><br>
                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> </span><br>
                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">
                        Women have a stronger preference for improved cookstoves
                        than men (and prefer healthy stoves in particular);
                        however, they appear to lack the decision-making power
                        to purchase the cookstoves.&nbsp; Women are more likely
                        to take and use stoves that are offered for free, but
                        have much greater refusal rates when even small prices
                        are charged.&nbsp; The twin problems suggest that one
                        cannot market only to women in Bangladesh (they do not
                        have the authority to purchase stoves), or only to men
                        (they have a lower preference for improved
                        stoves).&nbsp; The marketing must address both the men’s
                        and women’s preferences and constraints, and thus
                        bundling the product with a characteristic men value
                        (e.g. a cleaner stove that also generates electricity to
                        charge cell phones), may be a promising strategy.</span><br>

                            Abstract: Biomass combustion with traditional
                            cookstoves causes substantial environmental and
                            health harm. Nontraditional cookstove technologies
                            can be efficacious in reducing this adverse impact,
                            but they are adopted and used at puzzlingly low
                            rates. This study analyzes the determinants of low
                            demand for nontraditional cookstoves in rural
                            Bangladesh by using both stated preference (from a
                            nationally representative survey of rural women) and
                            revealed preference (assessed by conducting a
                            cluster-randomized trial of cookstove prices)
                            approaches. We find consistent evidence across both
                            analyses suggesting that the women in rural
                            Bangladesh do not perceive indoor air pollution as a
                            significant health hazard, prioritize other basic
                            developmental needs over nontraditional cookstoves,
                            and overwhelmingly rely on a free traditional
                            cookstove technology and are therefore not willing
                            to pay much for a new nontraditional cookstove.
                            Efforts to improve health and abate environmental
                            harm by promoting nontraditional cookstoves may be
                            more successful by designing and disseminating
                            nontraditional cookstoves with features valued more
                            highly by users, such as reduction of operating
                            costs, even when those features are not directly
                            related to the cookstoves’ health and environmental
                            impacts.</span></div>

                            This paper examines whether an intra-household
                            externality prevents adoption of a technology with
                            substantial implications for population health and
                            the environment: improved cookstoves. Motivated by a
                            model of intra-household decision-making, the
                            experiment markets stoves to husbands or wives in
                            turn at randomly varying prices. We find that women
                            – who bear disproportionate cooking costs – have
                            stronger preference for healthier stoves, but lack
                            the authority to make purchases. Our findings
                            suggest that if women cannot make independent
                            choices about household resource use, public policy
                            may not be able to exploit gender differences in
                            preferences to promote technology adoption absent

                        follow-up builds on a randomized intervention study that
                        identifies the relative quantitative importance of a
                        variety of socio-economic factors (price, lack of
                        information, intra-household gender-specific
                        preferences) that inhibit widespread cook-stove adoption
                        in Bangladesh. We re-visit the same set of villages and
                        strategically market to the friends, relatives and
                        neighbors of our first round study participants in order
                        to understand how best to use social networks to
                        disseminate the new technology.&nbsp; <br>
                        <br>
                        Taking advantage of different types of social network
                        relationships (e.g. extended family members living
                        within the same compound as our first-round households
                        versus friends living further away in the village, or
                        the relatives of the woman who cooks versus her
                        husband’s relatives), we can learn about underlying
                        mechanisms through which networks influence adoption
                        decisions.&nbsp; Our experimental design will vary the
                        identity of network households to whom different types
                        of information pass (e.g. friends living farther away
                        only get to taste the food cooked with the new stove
                        while extended family members living in close proximity
                        also observe smoke emissions and have opportunities to
                        try cooking with the new stove).&nbsp; We will also
                        collect detailed survey data on the nature of the
                        interactions between all network members to pinpoint
                        underlying mechanisms, such as a second round
                        household’s propensity to adopt as a function of tasting
                        food cooked with the stove versus their direct
                        experience cooking with the stove, or directly observing
                        smoke emissions.&nbsp; <br>

                    <p style="font-size: 11pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">With
                        a grant from Yale Climate and Energy Institute, further
                        follow-up research and collaboration aims to engineer a
                        clean, efficient, and context-appropriate cook-stove in
                        rural Bangladesh.&nbsp; This cook-stove solution will
                        require novel engineering combined with socio-economic
                        analyses of the constraints to new technology adoption,
                        and environmental science consideration of resource
                        constraints and consequences of use.&nbsp; Supplementary
                        experiments in our pre-existing field experiment
                        locations in rural Bangladesh will also allow us to
                        investigate the role of non-traditional factors in
                        deterring adoption, which will help inform the design of
                        the new Yale Stove for Bangladesh.&nbsp; Our empirical
                        strategy will leverage the fact that we already have
                        randomized variation in adoption of new improved stoves
                        among stoves among Bangladeshi households from previous
                        experiments.&nbsp; The engineering component of our team
                        will then obtain very detailed information about the
                        attributes of new stoves that matter most in determining
                        adoption rates, and this will ultimately lead to a
                        better and more appropriately designed stove.</span><br>
