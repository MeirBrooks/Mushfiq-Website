                          Bangladeshi society is characterized by conservative
                          gender norms, but recent industrial development has
                          created economic opportunities for women.&nbsp; In
                          collaboration with Rachel Heath (U. Washington), this
                          project examines the role of two developments in
                          particular: the rapid expansion of the ready-made
                          garments export industry and a subsidy of secondary
                          schooling for girls.&nbsp; The research survey
                          examines 1400 households in the outskirts of Dhaka,
                          collecting detailed work and schooling histories and
                          measuring female autonomy and marriage and fertility
                          outcomes.&nbsp; Some of the garment workers in the
                          sample work in the export processing zone, which also
                          allows the researchers to examine whether government
                          spending aimed to entice companies into an Export
                          Processing Zone translates into better wages and
                          conditions for its citizens.<br>
                         <br>
                        
                          The first aspect of the project focuses on the
                          short-run effects of a holding a job and being able to
                          control resources within the household, as well as the
                          long-run impacts of a job in the garment industry on
                          the woman’s timing of marriage, choice of partner,
                          fertility timing, and number of children.&nbsp; The
                          second element seeks to understand the trend of
                          garment factories to hire new employees through
                          referrals from current workers—whether it be to
                          economize on search costs or to identify and hire
                          better workers.&nbsp; The research looks at detailed
                          work histories to asses the job performance of
                          employees hired through different methods, as well as
                          information on referrers and referees, in order to
                          identify whether workers in the same family network
                          have similar skills or motivation and whether firms
                          prefer to assign workers of the same family network to
                          work in close contact with one another.&nbsp;
                          Understanding why referrals are beneficial to the
                          employer is important for designing policies that
                          ensure that the relatively well-paying garment jobs
                          are fairly accessible to all qualified workers, as
                          opposed to being concentrated in certain privileged
                          social networks.<br>
                         <br>
                        
                          Bangladesh has subsidized female secondary school
                          enrollment since the early 1990s. Educational
                          attainment among females has increased rapidly as a
                          result (from 22 percent in 1986 to 42 percent in 2007
                          according to UNICEF, and the rate now surpasses male
                          education). A collaborative project with Toan Do
                          (World Bank) seeks to understand the&nbsp; medium and
                          long-term consequences of this shift on female labor
                          force participation, and marriage and fertility
                          outcomes. Since the program was gradually phased-in
                          over the area studied, the outcomes for a girl of
                          school-age just before the program began can be
                          compared to her younger sister (or to another girl in
                          the same village) in school just after program
                          implementation, in order to isolate the effect of the
                          schooling subsidy from other coincident social and
                          economic changes.&nbsp; Since girls only receive the
                          stipend if they remain unmarried, analysis will begin
                          by testing whether the program indeed increased age at
                          marriage and decreased fertility.&nbsp; The project
                          will then explore subsequent marriages, including the
                          quality of the match, the husband’s characteristics,
                          and dowry payments.&nbsp; This research can both
                          address the economic theory that predicts that in
                          general equilibrium, a large-scale intervention
                          benefiting all females may not affect match quality at
                          all, as well as explore the important policy question
                          about the returns to education in the garment industry
                          and other sectors.&nbsp; </div>

                            Abstract: We study the effects of explosive growth
                            in the Bangladeshi ready-made garments industry on
                            the lives on Bangladeshi women. We compare the
                            marriage, childbearing, school enrollment and
                            employment decisions of women who gain greater
                            access to garment sector jobs to women living
                            further away from factories, to years before the
                            factories arrive close to some villages, and to the
                            marriage and enrollment decisions of their male
                            siblings. Girls exposed to the garment sector delay
                            marriage and childbirth. This stems from (a) young
                            girls becoming more likely to be enrolled in school
                            after garment jobs (which reward literacy and
                            numeracy) arrive, and (b) older girls becoming more
                            likely to be employed outside the home in
                            garment-proximate villages. The demand for education
                            generated through manufacturing growth appears to
                            have a much larger effect on female educational
                            attainment compared to a large-scale government
                            conditional cash transfer program to encourage
                            female schooling.</div>
