                        rural north-western districts of Bangladesh experience a
                        pre-harvest seasonal famine, locally known as Monga,
                        with disturbing regularity. Seven percent of the
                        population in Bangladesh (about 9.6 million people)
                        inhabits these districts and about 5.3 million of those
                        live below the poverty line. The suffering during Monga
                        thus is not limited to a small pocket of households. The
                        famine is emblematic of lean season or &#8216;hungry seasons&#8217;
                        preceding harvests that are widespread across Asia and
                        sub-Saharan Africa.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                      <br class="bodytext" />
                      <span class="bodytext">We conducted a field experiment
                        where incentives to promote seasonal out-migration
                        during Monga were randomly allocated across 1900
                        households in 100 villages in Lalmonirhat and Kurigram
                        districts. The program included an $8 cash grant (37
                        villages) or loan (31 villages) to mitigate the cost of
                        moving, information about (and endorsement of) migration
                        (16 villages) and control areas (16 villages), where we
                        tracked regular migration patterns without intervening.&#160;
                        Within each village, we imposed additional conditions to
                        random subsets of households (e.g. migrate in a group or
                        to a specific location).&#160; The randomization allows us to
                        cleanly estimate the effects of migration on household
                        expenditures, savings, earnings, and caloric intake.</span><br

                      <span class="bodytext">We find that seasonal out-migration
                        has large causal benefits for Monga-prone households.&#160;
                        In response to the $8 cash grant or loan, the migration
                        rate increased from 34% in control villages to 57% in
                        treatment (incentive) villages. Total expenditures, food
                        expenditures, and caloric intake increase by 30-35%.&#160;
                        Monthly consumption increased by $15/household.&#160; Caloric
                        intake increased by 700 calories per person per day.&#160;
                        Most strikingly, a year after the treatment (during the
                        next Monga season), migration rates in treatment
                        villages continue to be significantly higher (47% to
                        35%), even after inducement is removed.&#160; Those who were
                        successful appear to learn about the benefits of
                        migration and voluntarily re-migrate.</span><br class="bodytext" />

                      <span class="bodytext">These observed positive effects
                        make it puzzling why households fail to take advantage
                        of this apparently attractive investment.&#160; We find that
                        the data are most consistent with a rational model in
                        which people are uncertain about their own return to
                        migration, and do not experiment with this concept for
                        fear of a devastating outcome.&#160; In this migration
                        poverty trap, even if the chance of failure is low, the
                        potential cost of that failure may be so large (e.g. if
                        it moves a family under the threat of famine below
                        subsistence) that it dominates household
                        decision-making.</span><br class="bodytext" />

                      <span class="bodytext">Our small &#8220;incentive to invest&#8221;
                        insures against this kind of bad outcome and encourages
                        migration among those who were otherwise less
                        comfortable migrating.&#160; People close to subsistence
                        (facing a larger risk), or those without travel
                        partners, social networks or job leads at the
                        destination (i.e. other forms of insurance) are
                        generally less likely to migrate but are the most
                        responsive to our incentive.&#160; More broadly, these
                        results suggest that allowing people to find jobs may be
                        a very productive use of the micro-credit concept
                        currently more narrowly focused on creating new
                        entrepreneurs.</span><br class="bodytext" />

                          pre-harvest lean seasons is widespread in the agrarian
                          areas of Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. We randomly
                          assign an $8.50 incentive to households in rural
                          Bangladesh to temporarily out-migrate during the lean
                          season. The incentive induces 22% of households to
                          send a seasonal migrant, their consumption at the
                          origin increases significantly, and treated households
                          are 8&#8211;10 percentage points more likely to re-migrate 1
                          and 3 years after the incentive is removed. These
                          facts can be explained qualitatively by a model in
                          which migration is risky, mitigating risk requires
                          individual-specific learning, and some migrants are
                          sufficiently close to subsistence that failed
                          migration is very costly. We document evidence
                          consistent with this model using heterogeneity
                          analysis and additional experimental variation, but
                          calibrations with forward-looking households that can
                          save up to migrate suggest that it is difficult for
                          the model to quantitatively match the data. We
                          conclude with extensions to the model that could
                          provide a better quantitative accounting of the
                          behavior.</span></li>
