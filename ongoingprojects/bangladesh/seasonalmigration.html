                        The rural north-western districts of Bangladesh
                        experience a pre-harvest
                        seasonal famine, locally known as Monga, with disturbing
                        regularity. Seven percent of the population in
                        Bangladesh (about 9.6 million people) inhabits these
                        districts and about 5.3 million of those live below the
                        poverty line. The suffering during Monga thus is not
                        limited to a small pocket of households. The famine is
                        emblematic of lean season or ‘hungry seasons’ preceding
                        harvests that are widespread across Asia and sub-Saharan
                        Africa.</span><br class="bodytext">
                       <br class="bodytext">
                      <span class="bodytext">We
                        conducted a field experiment where incentives to promote
                        seasonal out-migration during Monga were randomly
                        allocated across 1900 households in 100 villages in
                        Lalmonirhat and Kurigram districts. The program included
                        an $8 cash grant (37 villages) or loan (31 villages) to
                        mitigate the cost of moving, information about (and
                        endorsement of) migration (16 villages) and control
                        areas (16 villages), where we tracked regular migration
                        patterns without intervening.&nbsp; Within each village,
                        we imposed additional conditions to random subsets of
                        households (e.g. migrate in a group or to a specific
                        location).&nbsp; The randomization allows us to cleanly
                        estimate the effects of migration on household
                        expenditures, savings, earnings, and caloric intake.</span><br class="bodytext">
                       <br class="bodytext">
                      <span class="bodytext"> We
                        find that seasonal out-migration has large causal
                        benefits for Monga-prone households.&nbsp; In response
                        to the $8 cash grant or loan, the migration rate
                        increased from 34% in control villages to 57% in
                        treatment (incentive) villages. Total expenditures, food
                        expenditures, and caloric intake increase by
                        30-35%.&nbsp; Monthly consumption increased by
                        $15/household.&nbsp; Caloric intake increased by 700
                        calories per person per day.&nbsp; Most strikingly, a
                        year after the treatment (during the next Monga season),
                        migration rates in treatment villages continue to be
                        significantly higher (47% to 35%), even after inducement
                        is removed.&nbsp; Those who were successful appear to
                        learn about the benefits of migration and voluntarily
                        re-migrate.</span><br class="bodytext">

                      <span class="bodytext">
                        These observed positive effects make it puzzling why
                        households fail to take advantage of this apparently
                        attractive investment.&nbsp; We find that the data are
                        most consistent with a rational model in which people
                        are uncertain about their own return to migration, and
                        do not experiment with this concept for fear of a
                        devastating outcome.&nbsp; In this migration poverty
                        trap, even if the chance of failure is low, the
                        potential cost of that failure may be so large (e.g. if
                        it moves a family under the threat of famine below
                        subsistence) that it dominates household
                        decision-making. </span><br class="bodytext">

                      <span class="bodytext"> Our
                        small “incentive to invest” insures against this kind of
                        bad outcome and encourages migration among those who
                        were otherwise less comfortable migrating.&nbsp; People
                        close to subsistence (facing a larger risk), or those
                        without travel partners, social networks or job leads at
                        the destination (i.e. other forms of insurance) are
                        generally less likely to migrate but are the most
                        responsive to our incentive.&nbsp; More broadly, these
                        results suggest that allowing people to find jobs may be
                        a very productive use of the micro-credit concept
                        currently more narrowly focused on creating new
                        entrepreneurs.</span><br class="bodytext">

                        Abstract:
                          Hunger during pre-harvest lean seasons is widespread
                          in the agrarian areas of Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
                          We randomly assign an $8.50 incentive to households in
                          rural Bangladesh to temporarily out-migrate during the
                          lean season. The incentive induces 22% of households
                          to send a seasonal migrant, their consumption at the
                          origin increases significantly, and treated households
                          are 8–10 percentage points more likely to re-migrate 1
                          and 3 years after the incentive is removed. These
                          facts can be explained qualitatively by a model in
                          which migration is risky, mitigating risk requires
                          individual-specific learning, and some migrants are
                          sufficiently close to subsistence that failed
                          migration is very costly. We document evidence
                          consistent with this model using heterogeneity
                          analysis and additional experimental variation, but
                          calibrations with forward-looking households that can
                          save up to migrate suggest that it is difficult for
                          the model to quantitatively match the data. We
                          conclude with extensions to the model that could
                          provide a better quantitative accounting of the
                          behavior.</li>
