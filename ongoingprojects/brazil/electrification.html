                        Governments and donors choose whether to allocate extra
                        dollars of public funds to health or education programs,
                        to build roads, or to extend coverage&nbsp; of
                        electricity or other public services.&nbsp; Social
                        scientists are expected to inform policy-makers about
                        the returns to public investments through conducting
                        small-scale randomized experiments.&nbsp; In light of
                        this responsibility, this project focuses on the
                        construction and expansion (through generation plants
                        and transmission lines) of the electric grid that was
                        created in Brazil between 1960 and 2000. </span><br>

                      <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">Expansions
                        of electric grids reflect both cost considerations
                        (where is it cheapest to generate electricity?) and
                        demand-side concerns (where are firms and people
                        located, and where is demand for power likely to grow
                        most?). The latter complicates efforts to estimate the
                        effects of electrification. Grid placement reflects
                        demand side concerns, cost considerations, and geography
                        (where hydro-power generation is able to intercept water
                        at a high velocity).&nbsp; This research isolates the
                        portion of the variation in grid expansions in Brazil
                        that is attributable to “exogenous” cost considerations
                        by building an engineering model that takes as inputs
                        only geography (river gradient, water flow and jungle),
                        and predicts the placement of hydropower plants and
                        transmission lines in order to generate maps of
                        hypothetical electricity grids for Brazil that show how
                        the grid would have evolved had infrastructure
                        investments been made based solely on geologic cost
                        considerations, ignoring all demand-side concerns. We
                        use these modeled hypothetical maps to instrument for
                        the actual variation in electrification across Brazil
                        during 1960-2000, and estimate electricity’s effect on a
                        broad range of development outcomes. <br>
                        <br>
                        We find that electrification of a county raises the
                        value of the housing stock by over a full standard
                        deviation in both urban and rural areas. It increases
                        the employment rate by 15 percentage points, raises
                        average incomes by a full standard deviation (50% of the
                        mean income across Brazil), reduces the poverty head
                        count ratio by 36 percentage points, and overall, raises
                        the county’s UNDP Human Development Index score by half
                        a standard deviation. We find negligible effects of
                        electricity on population density, in-migration and
                        mortality, which is suggestive that the positive
                        developmental outcomes are not entirely driven by other
                        ‘general equilibrium’ effects such as immigration to
                        electrified areas or selective in-migration by skilled
                        workers and firms. We thus interpret the positive
                        effects as indications of a true causal effect of
                        electricity on some aspect of productivity.<br>
                        <br>
                        We also find that electrification allows farmers to
                        irrigate, which leads to higher productivity, especially
                        in areas with volatile rainfall patterns. Farming
                        expands into frontier lands, and cultivation intensifies
                        in existing land through investments in mechanization,
                        fertilizer and pesticides. Crop intensification and
                        substitution away from land-intensive cattle grazing
                        lead to greater protection of forests and native
                        vegetation within farms. Expansion of agriculture and
                        this<br>
                        substitution have opposing effects on forest protection,
                        and overall we estimate a net decrease in deforestation
                        associated with electrification.</span><br>

                          electrification in Brazil between 1960 and 2000 on
                          changes in the structure of rural agricultural

                          investments, changes in land use, and the allocation
                          of effort between crop cultivation and cattle grazing.
                          The instrumental variables based identification
                          strategy simulates a time series of hypothetical

                          evolved had hydro-power dams (which require

                          Electrification allows farmers to irrigate, which
                          leads to higher productivity, especially in areas with
                          volatile rainfall patterns. Farming expands into
                          frontier lands, and cultivation intensifies in
                          existing land through investments in mechanization,
                          fertilizer and pesticides. Crop intensification and
                          substitution away from land-intensive cattle grazing
                          lead to greater protection of forests and native
                          vegetation within farms. Expansion of agriculture and
                          this substitution have opposing effects on forest
                          protection, and overall we estimate a net decrease in
                          deforestation associated with electrification.</span></li>
