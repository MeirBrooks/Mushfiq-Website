                  <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    <span class="bodytext">Governments and donors choose whether to
                    allocate extra dollars of public funds to health or education
                    programs, to build roads, or to extend coverage&nbsp; of electricity
                    or other public services.&nbsp; Social scientists are expected to
                    inform policy-makers about the returns to public investments through
                    conducting small-scale randomized experiments.&nbsp; In light of this
                    responsibility, this project focuses on the construction and
                    expansion (through generation plants and transmission lines) of the
                    electric grid that was created in Brazil between 1960 and
                    2000.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">Expansions of electric grids reflect both cost
                    considerations (where is it cheapest to generate electricity?) and
                    demand-side concerns (where are firms and people located, and where
                    is demand for power likely to grow most?). The latter complicates
                    efforts to estimate the effects of electrification. Grid placement
                    reflects demand side concerns, cost considerations, and geography
                    (where hydro-power generation is able to intercept water at a high
                    velocity).&nbsp; This research isolates the portion of the variation
                    in grid expansions in Brazil that is attributable to
                    &#8220;exogenous&#8221; cost considerations by building an
                    engineering model that takes as inputs only geography (river
                    gradient, water flow and jungle), and predicts the placement of
                    hydropower plants and transmission lines in order to generate maps of
                    hypothetical electricity grids for Brazil that show how the grid
                    would have evolved had infrastructure investments been made based
                    solely on geologic cost considerations, ignoring all demand-side
                    concerns. We use these modeled hypothetical maps to instrument for
                    the actual variation in electrification across Brazil during
                    1960-2000, and estimate electricity&#8217;s effect on a broad range
                    of development outcomes.</span><br class="bodytext" />
                    <br class="bodytext" />
                    <span class="bodytext">We find that electrification of a county
                    raises the value of the housing stock by over a full standard
                    deviation in both urban and rural areas. It increases the employment
                    rate by 15 percentage points, raises average incomes by a full
                    standard deviation (50% of the mean income across Brazil), reduces
                    the poverty head count ratio by 36 percentage points, and overall,
                    raises the county&#8217;s UNDP Human Development Index score by half
                    a standard deviation. We find negligible effects of electricity on
                    population density, in-migration and mortality, which is suggestive
                    that the positive developmental outcomes are not entirely driven by
                    other &#8216;general equilibrium&#8217; effects such as immigration
                    to electrified areas or selective in-migration by skilled workers and
                    firms. We thus interpret the positive effects as indications of a
                    true causal effect of electricity on some aspect of
                    productivity.</span><br class="bodytext" />

                    farmers to irrigate, which leads to higher productivity, especially

                    frontier lands, and cultivation intensifies in existing land through
                    investments in mechanization, fertilizer and pesticides. Crop
                    intensification and substitution away from land-intensive cattle
                    grazing lead to greater protection of forests and native vegetation

                    hypothetical electricity grids for Brazil for the period 1960-2000
                    that show how the grid would have evolved had infrastructure

                    considerations. Using the model as an instrument, we document large
                    positive effects of electrification on development that are
                    underestimated when one fails to account for endogenous targeting.
                    Broad-based improvement in labor productivity across sectors and
                    regions rather than general equilibrium re-sorting appears to be the

                    Abstract: We study the effects of the impressive growth in
                    electrification in Brazil between 1960 and 2000 on changes in the
                    structure of rural agricultural production, including adoption of
                    irrigation, increases in agricultural productivity and investments,
                    changes in land use, and the allocation of effort between crop
                    cultivation and cattle grazing. The instrumental variables based
                    identification strategy simulates a time series of hypothetical
                    electricity grids that show how the grid would have evolved had
                    hydro-power dams (which require intercepting water at high velocity)
                    been allocated solely on geography-based cost considerations.
                    Electrification allows farmers to irrigate, which leads to higher
                    productivity, especially in areas with volatile rainfall patterns.
                    Farming expands into frontier lands, and cultivation intensifies in
                    existing land through investments in mechanization, fertilizer and
                    pesticides. Crop intensification and substitution away from
                    land-intensive cattle grazing lead to greater protection of forests
                    and native vegetation within farms. Expansion of agriculture and this
                    substitution have opposing effects on forest protection, and overall
                    we estimate a net decrease in deforestation associated with
                    electrification.</li>
