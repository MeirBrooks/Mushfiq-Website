                        In this study we examine the effect of political
                        decentralization on spillovers across jurisdictional
                        boundaries.&nbsp; Upstream water use has spillover
                        effects on downstream jurisdictions, and greater
                        decentralization (i.e. a larger number of political
                        jurisdictions managing the same river) may exacerbate
                        these spillovers, as upstream communities have fewer
                        incentives to restrain their members from polluting the
                        river at the border. We use Geographic Information
                        System (GIS) data combined with a panel dataset of 9,000
                        water quality measures collected at 321 monitoring
                        stations across Brazil with maps of the evolving
                        boundaries of the 5500 Brazilian counties in order to
                        study (a) whether water quality degrades across
                        jurisdictional boundaries due to increases in pollution
                        close a river’s exit point out of a jurisdiction, and
                        (b) what the net effect of a decentralization initiative
                        on water quality is (once the opposing impacts of
                        inter-jurisdictional pollution spillovers and increased
                        local government budgets for cleaning up the water are
                        taken into account). We take advantage of the fact that
                        Brazil changes county (municipio) boundaries at every
                        election cycle, so that the same river segment may cross
                        different numbers of counties in different years.</span><br>

                        Our findings demonstrate evidence of strategic
                        enforcement of water pollution regulations; there is a
                        significant increase in pollution close to the river’s
                        exit point from the upstream county, and conversely a
                        significant decrease in pollution when the measure is
                        taken farther downstream from the point of entrance.
                        Pollution increases at an increasing rate as we get
                        closer to the border. The greatest polluting activity
                        appears to be very close to the exiting border. Our
                        theoretical model, coupled with the empirical results,
                        strongly suggests that these results are evidence of
                        strategic spillovers rather than a spurious correlation
                        between county splits and pollution stemming from
                        changing population density.</span><br class="bodytext">

                        These results suggest that decentralization policies
                        promoted by government and international organization
                        may come at an efficiency cost when local jurisdictions
                        provide public services with inter-jurisdictional
                        spillovers.&nbsp; Solutions to water conflicts across
                        borders may require active regulatory involvement by
                        upper-level bodies, or the creation of a forum for
                        negotation and cooperation, as compenstation in the form
                        of direct inter-jurisdiction financial transfers may not
                        be practically or politically feasible.</span><br class="bodytext">

                          Abstract: Decentralization can improve targeting of
                          local services, but it can also generate externalities
                          across jurisdictional boundaries. We examine the
                          nature and size of externalities across jurisdictions
                          in a setting in which spillovers are important and
                          their effects transparent and measurable: pollution in
                          rivers as they cross borders. Panel data on water
                          pollution in Brazilian rivers coupled with county
                          splits that change the locations of borders allow us
                          to identify the spatial patterns of pollution as
                          rivers approach and cross borders, controlling for
                          fixed effects and trends specific to each location.
                          The theory of externalities predicts that pollution
                          should increase at an increasing rate as the river
                          approaches the downstream exit border, that there
                          should be a structural break in the slope of the
                          pollution function at the border, and that a larger
                          number of managing jurisdictions should exacerbate
                          pollution externalities. We find support for all four
                          predictions in the data. We also show that it is
                          difficult to reconcile other theories and mechanisms
                          with the four pieces of congruent evidence we report.
                          These results suggest that decentralization policies
                          promoted by governments and international
                          organizations may come at an efficiency cost when
                          local jurisdictions provide public services with
                          inter-jurisdictional spillovers. We provide this
                          evidence in an important setting: over one billion
                          people in the world lack sufficient potable water, and
                          80 percent of sewage is dumped into surface water
                          untreated.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></li>
