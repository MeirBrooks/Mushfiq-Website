                    <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> The
                      rural north-western districts of Bangladesh experience a
                      pre-harvest seasonal famine, locally known as Monga, with
                      disturbing regularity. 7 percent of the population in
                      Bangladesh (about 9.6 million people) inhabits these
                      districts and about 5.3 million of those live below the
                      poverty line. The suffering during Monga thus is not
                      limited to a small pocket of households. The famine is
                      emblematic of lean season or ‘hungry seasons’ preceding
                      harvests, that are widespread across Asia and sub-Saharan
                      Africa.<br>
                      <br>
                      Inspired by the observations that wages are higher, jobs
                      are more plentiful in nearby urban areas than in the
                      Monga-prone region, and that there are no official
                      restrictions on mobility, this study provides monetary
                      incentives in 100 study villages to encourage people to
                      seasonally migrate out in search of employment during the
                      Monga season.&nbsp; We conducted a field experiment where
                      incentives to promote seasonal out-migration during Monga
                      were randomly allocated across 1900 households in 100
                      villages in Lalmonirhat and Kurigram districts. The
                      program included an $8 cash grant (37 villages) or a loan
                      (31 villages) to mitigate the cost of moving, information
                      about (and endorsement of) migration (16 villages), and
                      control areas (16 villages) where we tracked regular
                      migration patterns without intervening.&nbsp; Within each
                      village, we imposed additional conditionalities to random
                      subsets of households (e.g. migrate in a group or to a
                      specific location).&nbsp; The randomization allows us to
                      cleanly estimate the effects of migration on household
                      expenditures, savings, earnings, and caloric intake.<br>
                      <br>
                      We find that seasonal out-migration has large causal
                      benefits for Monga-prone households.&nbsp; In response to
                      the $8 cash grant or loan, the migration rate increased
                      from 34% in control villages to 57% in treatment
                      (incentive) villages. Total expenditures, food
                      expenditures, and caloric intake increase by 30-35%.&nbsp;
                      Monthly consumption increased by $15/household.&nbsp;
                      Caloric intake increased by 700 calories per person per
                      day.&nbsp; Most strikingly, a year after the treatment
                      (during the next Monga season), migration rates in
                      treatment villages continue to be significantly higher
                      (47% to 35%), even after inducement is removed.&nbsp;
                      Those who were successful appear to have learned about the
                      benefits of migration, and voluntarily re-migrate.<br>
                      <br>
                      These observed positive effects make it puzzling why
                      households fail to take advantage of this apparently
                      attractive investment.&nbsp; We analyze this question, and
                      find that the data are most consistent with a rational
                      model in which people are uncertain about their own return
                      to migration, and do not experiment with this concept for
                      fear of a devastating outcome.&nbsp; In this migration
                      poverty trap, even if the chance of failure is low, the
                      potential cost of that failure may be so large (e.g. if it
                      moves a family under the threat of famine below
                      subsistence) that it dominates household decision-making.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Our small “incentive to invest” insures against this kind
                      of bad outcome and encourages migration among those who
                      were otherwise less comfortable migrating.&nbsp; People
                      close to subsistence (facing a larger risk), or those
                      without travel partners, social networks or job leads at
                      the destination (i.e. substitute forms of insurance) are
                      generally less likely to migrate, but most responsive to
                      our incentive.&nbsp; More broadly, these results suggest
                      that allowing people to find jobs may be a very productive
                      use of the micro-credit concept currently more narrowly
                      focused on creating new entrepreneurs.<br>
